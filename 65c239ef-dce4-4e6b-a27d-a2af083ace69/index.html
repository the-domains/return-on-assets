The council also informs high-level planning and budgeting processes to find best value solutions for associated procurement. </p><p>• Combine a centralized strategy for consensus with decentralized execution. Local fit with global direction is crucial to ensure buy-in, especially in a rapidly changing world. </p><p>•Use technology to support their systems, not the other way around. Good companies don’t invest in hardware, software, furniture or  change and then reorganize to support it. Workplace is about <i>how </i>a company does things, <a href="null">not <i>what</i></a><i></i>they do.</p><p>• Work closely with suppliers long after the deal is signed. They understand it’s not about a transaction, it’s about a relationship and they work <i>together </i>to keep the relationship healthy, solve problems, develop continuous improvement goals, and meet performance goals. They're both intimately involved in the innovation life-cycle so both buyer and supplier are more successful. </p><p>• Involve internal “customers” across functional areas in workplace and procurement decision-making. Managers are enablers not controllers, they remove impediments instead of creating rules.</p><p>• Understand “total cost of ownership” is more important than purchase price, that ROI is more important than expenditure.</p><p>• Place growing emphasis on demand planning and forecasting.
